# Project name

One paragraph explaining the project. It should be breif and explain what the project does rather than exactly how its built.

_Optional_: If the project is not ready for production use it can be a good idea to add a note about the project status &mdash; for example _Experimetal_, _Alpha_ etc (also use emoji :warning: :construction: :information_source: to catch attention).

## Getting started

Here you should explain how a user of the project can get it up and running on their own machine.

### Prerequisites

List anything that the project requires for setup. For example it could be things like programming languages, databases, docker etc.

### Installing

Explain the installation process shortly. You shouldn't explain every possible installation option here. Try to be brief and cover the standard case and then add links to where the user can find more information.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jobtechswe/<project-name>
cd <project-name>
# further commands to install the project
```

If applicable add instructions for how the user starts a local server, for example

```bash
npm run server
```

## Test

Explain how to setup and get the tests running locally.

```bash
npm run test
```

## Deployment

If your project can be deployed add a short instruction for how the user can deploy the project. Similar to the [installation](#installation) section don't cover all the details, instead add links to more info.

## Built with

Add a high level list of what technology and tools the project is built with.

## Contributing

For small projects you can just add a few sentences if and how you'd like people to contribute.

For larger projects add a  [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING_TEMPLATE.md) file with a detailed description of how contributions are to be made. See the  [CONTRIBUTING.md template](CONTRIBUTING_TEMPLATE.md).

## License

Add the license name and a link to the license file that contains the full text.

## Acknowledgments

Add any acknowledgments you might want to share (inspiration etc.).
